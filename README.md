# Multi-task-Deep-Learning-for-Quantifying-Key-Histopathological-Features-in-Oral-Cancer
- Digital pathology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) allow for reproducible measurement of histopathological features at the Whole-Slide Image (WSI) level. Patch-based pipelines with CNNs have already shown strong performance for Tumour-Versus-Non-Tumour (TVNT) triage and downstream feature detection in oral cancer. In such workflows, WSIs are tiled (e.g. 256-512 px at 40x) to make gigapixel images computationally manageable; annotations are prepared in QuPath; CNNs such as ResNet/DenseNet classify image tiles; and encoder-decoder architectures (e.g. U-Net/K-Net) perform fine-grained segmentation and detection. These approaches improve consistency and efficiency compared with manual assessments.
